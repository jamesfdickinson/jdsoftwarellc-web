        <h1>Voice Coder</h1>
        <p>Voice Coder helps you learn about coding by programming a game with your voice and Alexa. 
            It's designed for kids and beginners to get started with coding concepts in a fun and interactive way.</p>

        <p>
<p>

Rules include events, actions, and sometimes values. Events are when something happens. Actions do stuff, like move, play a sound, or give points. You can add a new rule by saying, "add new rule".
</p><p>
Once your game is created, you can play it on your mobile or desktop computer. To play your game, go to, voice coder dot net and enter your access code. You can share you created game with other with that same code. Just ask me for your access code.

Say, "Add rule" to add a rule<br>
Say, "New game" to start a new game.<br>

Say, "Alexa, ask Voice Coder to ..." to skip opening the skill.<br>
