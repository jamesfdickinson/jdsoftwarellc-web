        <h1>Gin Rummy JD</h1>
        <p>Gin Rummy is a classic card game where players aim to form sets or runs of cards in their hand to reduce points. They can either "knock" when they believe they have the lowest score or achieve "Gin" by melding all cards. The game continues until a player reaches a predetermined winning score, requiring strategic thinking and calculation skills.</p>
        <p>Gin Rummy is a two-player card game where the objective is to form sets or runs of cards to minimize points. Players can either draw from the deck or pick up the last discarded card and must discard a card each turn. The game revolves around building melds and minimizing deadwood, the unmatched cards in a player's hand. The first player to reach the predetermined target score wins the game. Gin Rummy combines elements of strategy, memory, and risk assessment, making it an engaging and popular choice for players of all skill levels.</p>
