        <h1>Cribbage JD</h1>
        <p>The <a href="https://cardsjd.com/cribbage/">classic card game Cribbage</a> also known as Crib, Cribble, and Noddy. A card game traditionally for two
            players, that involves playing and grouping cards in combinations which gain points. Cribbage has several
            distinctive features: the cribbage board used for score keeping, the crib, box, or kitty, a separate hand
            counting for the dealer, two distinct scoring stages (the play and the show), aces low, and a unique scoring
            system including points for groups of cards that total fifteen.</p>
        <p>This Cribbage app lets you play the classic card game Cribage anywhere without needing your wooden Cribbage
            pegging board. The playing cards are large so Grandpa will have no trouble playing his favorite board game.
            All the scoring is automatic using the built-in <a href="https://cribbagecalculator.com/">cribbage calculator</a> including a breakdown of the point details.</p>
