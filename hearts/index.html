            Hearts is a classic trick-taking card game typically played by four players. The objective is to avoid
            capturing certain cards that carry penalty points, particularly hearts and the Queen of Spades. Players take
            turns leading a card, and other players must follow suit if possible. However, players are not allowed to
            lead with hearts until they have been "broken" in a previous trick. The game continues until one player
            reaches a predetermined point threshold, at which point the player with the lowest score wins. Hearts is
            known for its simple rules yet strategic depth, requiring players to carefully manage their hands and
            anticipate opponents' moves.</p>

            Hearts encourages players to balance between capturing high-value cards and avoiding penalty points, adding
            a layer of tension and decision-making to each round. While luck plays a role in the cards dealt, successful
            players often employ tactics such as "shooting the moon," where they attempt to capture all the hearts and
            the Queen of Spades to inflict penalty points on opponents. The game fosters a mix of careful calculation,
            risk assessment, and psychological maneuvering, making it a timeless favorite for casual players and card
            game enthusiasts alike.
